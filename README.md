# Seven-Segment-HVAC-Controller
A VHDL project that models an HVAC controller and displays status via 7-segment hardware:

- Files: LogicalStep_Lab3_top.vhd (top), HVAC.vhd (control logic), segment7_mux.vhd & SevenSegment.vhd (display), Tester.vhd (stimulus/test).

- Showcases FSM design, output encoding, and time-multiplexed 7-segment driving.

- Provided as source-only (no .qsf/.qpf); intended to be added to a Quartus project targeting your dev board.
